README for the Open Clip Art Library
------------------------------------

This is a collection of 100% license-free, royalty-free, and
restriction-free art that you can use for any purpose.

Most of the art in this package is in the Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) 
format, which is an XML format approved by the W3C and used in a wide
range of software applications, including Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator,
Batik, and more.

The goal of the Open Clip Art Library is to provide the public with a
huge collection of reusable art.

Some highlights about this release can be seen in the RELEASE*.svg
file.  Also, look in the Examples directory for templates and
tutorials on ways to make use of the clipart. 

For more information, including how you can contribute to this growing
library, please see http://www.openclipart.org/.

And if you discover any images in the collection that *are* encumbered
in any way, e.g., by a trademark or a copyright claim, please let us
know, so that we can remove the item from the collection.
